# E-commerce App

## Project Description

This project is a Flutter e-commerce application allowing users to browse products, add items to a cart, and manage their profile.  The app utilizes Firebase for authentication and backend services.  State management is handled with the Provider package.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK installed and configured.  See [Flutter's Getting Started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) guide for installation instructions.
* An active Firebase project. Create one at [console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com).


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd flutter-project-2
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Project Structure

* **`android/`**: Android-specific project files.
* **`ios/`**: iOS-specific project files.
* **`lib/`**: Dart source code.
    * **`lib/main.dart`**: Application entry point.
    * **`lib/models/`**: Data models for products and other entities.
    * **`lib/providers/`**: Provider classes for state management (e.g., `auth_provider.dart`, `cart_provider.dart`, `products_provider.dart`).
    * **`lib/screens/`**: UI screens (e.g., `home_screen.dart`, `cart_screen.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `profile_screen.dart`, `register_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`, `product_details_screen.dart`).
* **`test/`**: Unit and widget tests.
* **`web/`**: Web-specific project files (if applicable).


## Firebase Setup

1.  **Add Firebase to your Flutter project:** Follow Firebase's instructions for adding Firebase to your Flutter project. This usually involves creating a Firebase project, registering your app, and downloading the `google-services.json` file (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` file (iOS).
2.  **Configure Firebase:**  Place the downloaded configuration files in the appropriate locations (`android/app/` and `ios/Runner/`).
3.  **Enable Firebase services:** Enable the necessary Firebase services in your Firebase console (e.g., Authentication, Firestore).


## Provider Architecture

The app uses the Provider package for state management.  Each provider manages a specific part of the application's state:

* **`AuthProvider`**: Manages user authentication.
* **`CartProvider`**: Manages the shopping cart.
* **`ProductsProvider`**: Manages the list of products.

These providers allow for easy access to and modification of the application's state from various widgets.

## Testing

The project includes unit and widget tests using the Flutter testing framework. To run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Deployment

To deploy to Android and iOS, follow the standard Flutter deployment procedures.  For web deployment, ensure you have the web configuration set up correctly in your `pubspec.yaml` file and follow the Flutter web deployment instructions.


## Future Enhancements

* Implement more robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
* Add features such as order tracking, payment integration, and user reviews.
* Improve the UI and UX based on user testing and feedback.
