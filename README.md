## Flutter E-commerce App

## Project Description

This project is a Flutter e-commerce application built with Firebase.  It allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, manage their account (login/register), and view their profile.

## Technology Stack

* Flutter
* Dart
* Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
* Provider (State Management)
* flutter_spinkit

## Project Structure

The project follows standard Flutter conventions. The `lib/` directory contains the source code, organized into folders:

* **`lib/models/`**: Data models for products and other data structures (e.g., `product.dart`).
* **`lib/providers/`**: State management providers using Provider (e.g., `auth_provider.dart`, `cart_provider.dart`, `products_provider.dart`).
* **`lib/screens/`**: UI screens (e.g., `home_screen.dart`, `cart_screen.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `register_screen.dart`, `product_details_screen.dart`, `profile_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`).
* **`lib/main.dart`**: The main application entry point.

The `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/` directories contain platform-specific code for building the application on respective platforms. The `web/` directory contains the code for building the web application.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured correctly. See [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for instructions.
* Android Studio or VS Code: You'll need an IDE to work with the Flutter project.
* An Emulator or Physical Device: You will need either an Android emulator, iOS simulator, macOS simulator, or physical devices to run the application.


### Cloning the Repository and Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd flutter-project-2
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console ([console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com)).
2. Add your Android and iOS apps to your Firebase project. This will generate the `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) files. Ensure these are correctly placed in their respective platform directories.
3. Install the necessary Firebase packages (listed in `pubspec.yaml`).
4. Configure `firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase project configuration data.  This file is automatically generated and contains the necessary keys for web, android, and iOS.

## Running the Application

### Android Setup

1. Connect your Android emulator or device.
2. Run: `flutter run`

### iOS Setup

1. Connect your iOS simulator or device.
2. Run: `flutter run`

### Web Setup

1. Run: `flutter run -d web-server`
2. Open the generated web app in a browser.

### Desktop Setup (Linux, macOS, Windows)

Refer to Flutter's documentation for building and running the application on desktop platforms. The necessary files are included for each platform.


## Testing

The project uses the Flutter testing framework. Widget tests are included in the `test/` directory and can be run using:
