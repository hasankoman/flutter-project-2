# E-commerce App

## Project Description

This project is a Flutter e-commerce application allowing users to browse products, add items to a cart, manage their profile, and securely log in/register.  The app utilizes Firebase for backend services, including authentication and database management.

## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Dart
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)


## Project Structure

The project is structured in a standard Flutter way:

* **`android/`:** Android-specific code for the application.
* **`ios/`:** iOS-specific code for the application.
* **`lib/`:** Dart source code for the application.
    * **`lib/main.dart`:** Application entry point.
    * **`lib/models/`:** Data models for products and other entities.
    * **`lib/providers/`:** State management providers using Provider package (or similar).  Includes `auth_provider.dart`, `cart_provider.dart`, and `products_provider.dart`.
    * **`lib/screens/`:** UI screens for the application. Includes screens for home, product details, cart, login, registration, and profile.
* **`web/`:** Web-specific code for the application (if applicable).
* **`test/`:** Unit and widget tests.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. **Install Flutter SDK:**  Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured correctly. See the official Flutter documentation for instructions.

3. **Navigate to project directory:**

```bash
cd flutter-project-2
```

4. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase project:** Create a new project in the Firebase console ([console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com)).

2. **Add Firebase to your Flutter app:** Follow the instructions in the Firebase documentation to add the Firebase SDK to your Flutter application. This typically involves adding a `google-services.json` file to the `android/app/` directory and a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the `ios/Runner/` directory.

3. **Configure Firebase services:** Configure the necessary Firebase services:
    * **Authentication:**  Enable Firebase Authentication and choose the authentication methods you want to support (e.g., email/password).
    * **Firestore:** Create a Firestore database to store your product data.

4. **Add `firebase_core` and other Firebase plugins:** Add the required Firebase plugins to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get`.  You'll likely need at least `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, and `cloud_firestore`.

## Running the Application

1. **Connect a device or start an emulator:** Connect your physical device or launch an emulator.

2. **Run the application:**

```bash
flutter run
```

This will build and run your application on the connected device or emulator.

## Testing

The project includes unit and widget tests in the `test/` directory. Run tests using:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Deployment (if applicable)

The deployment process will depend on the target platform (Android, iOS, web).  Consult the Flutter documentation for details on deploying to each platform's respective app store or web hosting service.
