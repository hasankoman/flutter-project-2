# E-commerce App

## Project Description

This project is a Flutter e-commerce application allowing users to browse products, add items to a cart, manage their profile, and authenticate securely.  The app utilizes Firebase for backend services, including authentication and database management.


## Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Dart
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Version:**  (Please specify the Flutter version used.  e.g., Flutter 3.7.12)
* **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)


## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Flutter structure:

* **`android/`:** Contains the Android-specific code for the application.
* **`ios/`:** Contains the iOS-specific code for the application.
* **`lib/`:** Contains the Dart source code.
    * **`lib/main.dart`:** The entry point of the application.
    * **`lib/models/`:**  Contains data models for products and other entities. (e.g., `product.dart`)
    * **`lib/providers/`:**  Contains state management providers. (e.g., `auth_provider.dart`, `products_provider.dart`, `cart_provider.dart`)
    * **`lib/screens/`:** Contains the UI screens for different parts of the application. (e.g., `home_screen.dart`, `cart_screen.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `register_screen.dart`, `product_details_screen.dart`, `profile_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`)


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. **Install Flutter SDK:**  If you haven't already, download and install the Flutter SDK from [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  Make sure to add Flutter to your system's PATH.

3. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd flutter-project-2
```

4. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Firebase Setup

1. **Create a Firebase project:** Go to the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)) and create a new project.

2. **Register your app:**  In your Firebase project, register both your Android and iOS apps by providing the necessary package names and SHA-1 certificates. Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS.

3. **Add Firebase configuration files:** Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `android/app/` directory and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the `ios/Runner/` directory.

4. **Install Firebase plugins:** Add the necessary Firebase plugins to your `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get`.  For example, you'll likely need plugins for authentication and Firestore.

5. **Initialize Firebase:** Initialize Firebase in your Flutter app according to the Firebase documentation.


## Running the Application

1. **Connect a device or start an emulator:** Ensure you have a physical device connected or an emulator running (Android Studio's AVD Manager or Xcode's simulator).

2. **Run the app:**

```bash
flutter run
```

This will build and run the app on your connected device or emulator.


## Testing

The project includes widget tests which can be run using:

```bash
flutter test
```

Consider adding unit tests for more comprehensive testing coverage.


## Deployment (if applicable)

To deploy the application:

1.  **Build the release APK:** `flutter build apk --release` (for Android)
2.  **Build the release IPA:** `flutter build ios --release` (for iOS)
3.  **Upload the release APK/IPA** to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store respectively.
