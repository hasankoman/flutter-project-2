# Flutter E-commerce App

## Project Description

This project is a Flutter e-commerce application.  It allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, manage their account, and potentially more features depending on the current development stage.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK: Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured correctly.  See [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for instructions.
* Android Studio or VS Code:  You'll need an IDE to work with the Flutter project. Android Studio is recommended but VS Code is also a viable option.
* An Emulator or Physical Device:  You will need either an Android emulator or a physical Android device to run the application.


### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd flutter-project-2
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Project Structure

The project's structure is organized using standard Flutter conventions.  The `lib/` directory contains the source code, divided into folders for better organization.

* **`lib/models/`**: Contains data models for products and other data structures used in the app.  `product.dart` is an example.
* **`lib/providers/`**: Contains state management providers (likely using Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC).  Examples include `auth_provider.dart`, `cart_provider.dart`, and `products_provider.dart`.
* **`lib/screens/`**: Contains the UI screens of the application. Examples include `home_screen.dart`, `cart_screen.dart`, `login_screen.dart`, `register_screen.dart`, `product_details_screen.dart`, and `profile_screen.dart`.
* **`lib/main.dart`**: The main entry point of the application.


## Firebase Setup

This section assumes the app uses Firebase.  Detailed instructions may vary depending on the specific Firebase services integrated.

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console ([console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com)).
2. Add your Android and iOS apps to your Firebase project, following the instructions provided by Firebase.  This will generate the `google-services.json` file for Android and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS (These files are present in the project).
3. In your `pubspec.yaml` file ensure the firebase_core, firebase_auth, and other firebase packages are included and their versions match the pubspec.lock file.
4. Add `firebase_options.dart` to your `lib` directory.  This file contains the configuration data for the Firebase project and should match what's in the `firebase_app_id_file.json` files for each platform.

## Running the Application

1. Connect your Android emulator or device.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will build and run the application on the connected device or emulator.

## Testing

The project includes widget tests (`test/widget_test.dart`). To run the tests use:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Deployment

Deployment instructions are not included but will involve building a release version of the app and deploying to the respective app stores (Google Play Store and Apple App Store).  Additional build configuration may be required.
